#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
// Needs to be sorted
// Halfs till target is found

// Check the middle value for the value if not check if its less or more,
// If less delete every other value above it 
// Then repeat get middle --> greate that or less than --> delete 
// Everytime i say delete its just disregard

//          When would this be effiecnt:
// - Only on large data sets small is just not needed
//    - This is because you disregard HALF the elements in one its alot and can be very fast

// O (log n), (time, data)
